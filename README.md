# Discord-Bot
python discord bot with some a fair amount of commands

some of the code you will have to edit to add some stuff to the bot

# installing requirements
run the "install-reqs.bat" file so you can install all the modules this code uses

# issues
the ban command is kinda weird as to unban someone you need to use their discord ID but to ban them it works normally

the API key's for some of the API commands have been removed as those where my API keys that i can't let others have
so for the "IP Pinger" and "Port Scanner" commands you're going to need your own API key
